# Finch collector deliverable - Views and Models (Bonus: explore Templates!)
The lab for this lesson is repeating everything we just did, except youâ€™ll CRUD something else like Finches and call the project something like finchcollector, or whatever. Refer to today's lesson notes [here](https://github.com/WDI-SEA/django-crud) for creating a new django project, remember to create it inside your environment folder and make sure your `pipenv shell` is running.

- Fork and clone this repo
- Pick a resource. (Dogs, Cards, Stamps, etc)
- Initialize your project.
- Create your db.
- Configure your application to connect to the db.
- Create view classes to manage all CRUD actions(Index, Post, Show, Delete, Update) like we did today

## Bonus!
- Create a template view that extends a base for all the routes.
Because your completed Finch Collector app will be fairly comprehensive and be a nice addition to your portfolio, you should **create it outside of the class repo** so that you can make it a repo in your personal GitHub account.
